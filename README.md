## Instructions:
1. Download data from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
2. Unzip data
3. In each of the R code plot1.R to plot6.R update the line: setwd("C:\\Data Science Specialization JHU\\C4_Exploratory_Data_Analysis\\Project2") to set your working directory to the path along which you downloaded and unzipped the data to.
4. You should now be able to run the R code in each of of these 6 .R files. 
5. Packages used, which you may need to install:
   1. ggplot2
   1. ggrepel
6. Each one of these .R files will create a .png file named plot_x_.png in your working directory. If you would rather view these in your R plotting window then comment out the lines begining with "png(... " & "dev.off"
